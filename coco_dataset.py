class CustomCocoCaptions(torchvision.datasets.CocoDetection):
    """`MS Coco Captions <https://cocodataset.org/#captions-2015>`_ Dataset.

    It requires the `COCO API to be installed <https://github.com/pdollar/coco/tree/master/PythonAPI>`_.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory where images are downloaded to.
        annFile (string): Path to json annotation file.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.PILToTensor``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        transforms (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes input sample and its target as entry
            and returns a transformed version.

    Example:

        .. code:: python

            import torchvision.datasets as dset
            import torchvision.transforms as transforms
            cap = dset.CocoCaptions(root = 'dir where images are',
                                    annFile = 'json annotation file',
                                    transform=transforms.PILToTensor())

            print('Number of samples: ', len(cap))
            img, target = cap[3] # load 4th sample

            print("Image Size: ", img.size())
            print(target)

        Output: ::

            Number of samples: 82783
            Image Size: (3L, 427L, 640L)

            u'A mountain that has a plane flying overheard in the distance.',
            u'A mountain view with a plume of smoke in the background']
